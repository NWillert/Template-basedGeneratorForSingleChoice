@TASK
In 1935 Alan Turing published his famous paper "On Computable Numbers, with a n Application to the Entscheidungsproblem". In this paper he also conceptualized a universal machine being able to compute any computable function. Unfortunately this machine cannot be built in reality. What is a valid reason?
@TRUE
The machine would require an endless tape.
It could take endless time to process a tape.
@FALSE
The entirety of all computable functions is not known.
Some numbers cannot be computed, for example, irrational numbers.
The speed of light imposes a fundamental bareer for its construction.
Because of its simple construction, in many cases the algorithms would become too complex.
Its design and construction would be too expensive.
It cannot be sufficiently miniaturized.
@EXCLUSIONS
