@TASK
Which of the following statements is $bwrong$/b
@TRUE
Instantiating a pair with two different datatypes like pair<int, string> results in a compiler error.
Vectors cannot be nested.
@FALSE
std::tuple is a generalization of std::pair.
The toupper function converts a given character to uppercase.
Elements in a pair can be addressed separetely.
The code $cusing container_t = vector<pair<string,string>>;$/c enables the programmer to use container_t instead of the vector<pair<string,string>>
When applying the $c[[nodiscard]]$/c attribute to a function, the compiler might issue a warning when the result of the function is discarded.
